/**
 * Throttling pattern is a design pattern to throttle or limit the use of resources or even a complete service by
 * users or a particular tenant. This can allow systems to continue to function and meet service level agreements,
 * even when an increase in demand places load on resources.
 * <p>
 *     In this example we have ({@link App}) as the initiating point of the service.
 *     This is a time based throttling, i.e. only a certain number of calls are allowed per second.
 * </p>
 * ({@link Tenant}) is the Tenant POJO class with which many tenants can be created
 * ({@link B2BService}) is the service which is consumed by the tenants and is throttled.
