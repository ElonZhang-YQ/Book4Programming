/**
 * The Acyclic Visitor pattern allows new functions to be added to existing class 
 * hierarchies without affecting those hierarchies, and without creating the dependency 
 * cycles that are inherent to the GoF Visitor pattern, by making the Visitor base class 
 * degenerate
 * <p>
 * In this example the visitor base class is {@link ModemVisitor}. The base class of the 
 * visited hierarchy is {@link Modem} and has two children {@link Hayes} and {@link Zoom} 
 * each one having its own visitor interface {@link HayesVisitor} and {@link ZoomVisitor} 
 * respectively. {@link ConfigureForUnixVisitor} and {@link ConfigureForDosVisitor} 
 * implement each derivative's visit method only if it is required
