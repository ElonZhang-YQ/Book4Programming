Achieve flexibility of untyped languages and keep the type-safety 

![alt text](./etc/abstract-document.png "Abstract Document Traits and Domain")


## Applicability
Use the Abstract Document Pattern when

* there is a need to add new properties on the fly
* you want a flexible way to organize domain in tree like structure
* you want more loosely coupled system
