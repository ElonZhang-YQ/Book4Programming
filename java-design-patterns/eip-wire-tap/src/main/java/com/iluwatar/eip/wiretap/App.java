/**
 * In most integration cases there is a need to monitor the messages flowing through the system. It is usually achieved
 * by intercepting the message and redirecting it to a different location like console, filesystem or the database.
 * It is important that such functionality should not modify the original message and influence the processing path.

 * Wire Tap allows you to route messages to a separate location while they are being forwarded to the ultimate
 * destination. It basically consumes messages of the input channel and publishes the unmodified message to both
 * output channels.
