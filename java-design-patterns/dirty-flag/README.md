## Intent
To avoid expensive re-acquisition of resources. The resources retain their identity, are kept in some
fast-access storage, and are re-used to avoid having to acquire them again.

## Applicability
Use the Dirty Flag pattern when

* Repetitious acquisition, initialization, and release of the same resource causes unnecessary performance overhead.
