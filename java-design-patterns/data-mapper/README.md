## Intent
A layer of mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself

## Applicability
Use the Data Mapper in any of the following situations

* when you want to decouple data objects from DB access layer 
* when you want to write multiple data retrieval/persistence implementations
